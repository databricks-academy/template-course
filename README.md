# New Course Template

This repository contains the resources students need to follow along with the course, including demos, labs, and solutions.

See [documentation](https://www.databricks.training/step-by-step/importing-courseware-from-github) for instructions on importing courseware into a Databricks Workspace (with or without Databricks Repos).


## About this Course Template
This repository is meant to be a starting place for new courses that intend to use the [DBAcademy](https://github.com/databricks-academy/dbacademy/wiki) library and build tools maintained by the curriculum infrastructure team.
